### Loading Necessary Packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

### Data Preparation

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lb_police_stops <- read.csv('lbpd-ripa-data-annual.csv')


head(lb_police_stops)
```


### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

Research Question: Is there a meaningful difference in the stop frequency and 
actions taken by Long Beach Police Officers for civilians of different "Perceived
[Ethnicity]?"

Notes: The wording is "Perceived Race," but the correct wording should be 
"Perceived Ethnicity," hence the brackets around "Ethnicity." Also, it's important
to note the word "Perceived," this comes from the Police Officer's Perception of
of a civilian and is not an exact science, and it is the data to which we have
access.

### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**

The cases are the individual traffic stops that took place in the City of Long
Beach's Police Departments jurisdiction from 1/1/2019 to 12/31/2021. There are 
69,711 recorded stops and therefore there are 69,711 cases in this data.

```{r}
min(lb_police_stops$Stop.Date)
max(lb_police_stops$Stop.Date)
nrow(lb_police_stops)
```


### Data collection 

**Describe the method of data collection.**

This comes directly from the City of Long Beach Data Website, "This dataset 
captures information about the stops that were conducted by Long Beach Police 
Department. LBPD officers conducting stops capture information required by The 
Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 (AB 953). The data captured are 
submitted to the State of California annually, and is made available to the 
public via this dataset."

### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**

This is an observational study. In theory the police continue along with their 
normal policing tactics, but just record the information needed in accordance 
with the law.

### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

### Dependent Variable

**What is the response variable? Is it quantitative or qualitative?**

I'd like to look at a few response variables, Duration of the Stop, and treatment 
during the stop. Also, this is not so much a variable, but I think it will be 
important to look at the stop frequency compared across the specific demographic 
that I am looking at (Ethnicity, Gender, Able-Bodied/Disabled, etc.)

### Independent Variable(s)

The main independent variable I want to look at is "Perceived [Ethnicity]" and 
given that the data also provides "Perceived Gender," "Perceived LGBT," and 
"Perceived Disability," there are a few values that I could use as my indepedent 
variable to see how changing demographics may affect traffic stop frequency and 
treatment during the stop.


### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics for each the variables. Also include appropriate visualizations related to your research question (e.g. scatter plot, boxplots, etc). This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**


#### Overview: Percentages by Ethnicity Breakdown of all Stops

```{r}
Percent_by_Eth <- lb_police_stops %>%
  select("Perceived.Race.Simplified") %>%
  group_by(Perceived.Race.Simplified) %>%
  summarise(Percent_of_Stops = 100 * n()/nrow(.)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Percent_of_Stops))

knitr::kable(Percent_by_Eth)
```

#### Ethnicty vs Action Taken During Stop

```{r}
Action_Taken_by_Eth <- lb_police_stops %>%
  select("Perceived.Race.Simplified", "Num.Actions.Taken") %>%
  group_by(Perceived.Race.Simplified) %>%
  summarise(avg_num_of_actions = mean(Num.Actions.Taken)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_num_of_actions))

knitr::kable(Action_Taken_by_Eth)
```

#### Ethnicity vs Stop Duration Boxplot

```{r}
Stop_time_by_Eth <- lb_police_stops %>%
  select("Perceived.Race.Simplified", "Stop.Duration") %>%
  group_by(Perceived.Race.Simplified) %>%
  summarise(avg_stop_time = mean(Stop.Duration)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_stop_time))

knitr::kable(Stop_time_by_Eth)

boxplot(Stop.Duration~Perceived.Race.Simplified, data=lb_police_stops, main="Ethnicity and Traffic Stop Duration",
  xlab="Ethnicity", ylab="Stop Duration")
```

Because of the outliers, the boxplot may not be the clearest visualization
of the dynamic Ethnicity may play in influencing the Traffic Stop Experience.
